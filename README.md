Facebook cover photo generator for candidate Touko Aalto in the Finnish Parliament elections 2015.
Site running at http://touko2015.jannewaren.fi or http://facebook.toukoaalto.fi.
No database / ActiveRecord is used, and all photos are saved to disk.

Using ImageMagick / minimagick and Railsbricks.

If you have ever wondered what's "spaghetti code" or "quick and dirty" is, you're looking at it. Still,
I'm quite proud how well this turned out to be in just two nights. Perhaps this actually is a
good example on how to use minimagick / convert in Rails.
